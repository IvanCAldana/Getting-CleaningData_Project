# Getting-CleaningData_Project
Project for course Getting and Cleaning Data of Jhon Hopkins University

The script I wrote in Rstudio is attached in this repo as Run_analysis.R, and it intends to be self-explanatory by using comments troughout the code.

The basic guidelines are given as follows:

# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
# 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
# 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
# 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
#   for each activity and each subject
#   Good luck!

The summarized process, variables used/processed and its units as well as the final Tidy Dataset are all explained in the Codebook.md of this repo.
